##**Next Steps**
- To get a functional alert to let the winner know they won the game.
- To remove the ability to select the same card again after it has already been successfully matched.
- To add a a function that limits how many moves you can make per game, or else it restarts.
- Add more CSS styles to make the flipping of the cards more "life-like".
- To add a function, that after clicking 2 cards (match or not a match), that you cannot click on another card until the timeout function has completed (this is a bug issue currently).
